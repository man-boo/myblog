      <p>Dancing is my favorite hobby. Dancing makes me happy and calm. I'm always coming up with some different moves. I take dance lessons and it has helped from stage fright and I always feel confident when I walk on stage.I have been dancing since I was 6 and it has been so much fun .The person that inspired me to dance was my cousin when I saw her on stage I wanted to dance too. I love dancing, do you like to dance too? </p>
